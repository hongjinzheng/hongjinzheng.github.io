										<h1>Membrane Protein Structure and Function</h1>

									<header class="major">
										<h2>Overview</h2>
									</header>
										<p>Why do we take on the challenge of understanding the working mechanisms of various membrane proteins? 
										The first reason is that most drug targets found today are actually membrane proteins, so our studies could have pharmacuetical 
										potential in the future. The second reason is that membrane proteins account for ~30% of all proteins in all cells, so there are
										 plenty of unknowns waiting to be discovered. The third and most important reason is that it is HARD to work with membrane proteins,
										  but we have the expertise (protein biochemistry, biophysics, X-ray crystallogrphy, cryo electron microscopy, and many more) to deal with them!

										<h2>Siderophore ABC Importers</h2>
									</header>
										<p> Iron (Fe), like other metal ions, is essential for all life forms and plays vital roles in many biological processes, primarily 
											serving as cofactors for numerous proteins and enzymes. Thus, it is in the forefront of the battle fields between microorganisms and hosts.
											 To fight for these essential metal ions, human pathogens first secrete virulence-associated siderophores and then retake the 
											 metal-chelated siderophores through a subfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) importer, whose molecular mechanisms are completely unknown. 
											 We have determined multiple structures of yersiniabactin importer YbtPQ from uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) at inward-open conformation 
											 in both apo and substrate-bound states by cryo electron microscopy. YbtPQ does not adopt any known fold of ABC importers, but surprisingly 
											 adopt the fold of Type IV ABC exporters. To our knowledge, it is the first time an exporter fold of ABC importer has been reported. 
											  In addition, we have observed two unique features in YbtPQ: unwinding of a transmembrane helix in YbtP upon substrate release, 
											  as well as tightly associated nucleotide-binding domains without nucleotide bound. Altogether, our study suggests that siderophore ABC 
											  importers should be classified as a separate subfamily and have a distinct transport mechanism comparing to others.</p>

										<h2>Nitrate/Nitrite Antiporter</h2>
									</header>
										<p> Nitrogen is essential to all life on earth. One of the major nitrogen source for cells is nitrate. How nitrate (and nitrite) gets accross the
										 cell membrane has long been a mystery, untill we solve the first structure of a nitrate/nitrite transporter NarK from E.coli.
										  But it was only the first step to understand the nitrate/nitrite transport cycle. We aim to a detailed understanding of the substrate selectivity
										   and translocation process carried out by these nitrate/nitrite porters from various species.

										<h2>Mitochondrial Accumulation of Amyloid-beta</h2>
									</header>
										<p> The mitochondrial accumulation of intracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease is extremely toxic 
											because Aβ disrupts the normal functions of many mitochondrial proteins, resulting in significant mitochondrial dysfunction. However, little is 
											known about the detail molecular mechanism of this accumulation. We presented direct experimental evidence suggesting that Aβ is specifically recognized
											 by a noncanonical receptor within the mitochondrial protein import machinery, named Tom22 in yeast or TOMM22 in human, and that this recognition is 
											 critical for Aβ accumulation in mitochondria. This work not only confirmed that yeast mitochondria can be used as a model to 
										 study mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Aβ peptides in AD but also paved the way for future studies of the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial Aβ accumulation.
